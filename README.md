# API for Bookshelf web app

This is an API developed to serve as the back-end for a to-be developed online personal library. It has routes to list, add, update and delete books/authors and routes for user login and registration. Routes to access books endpoints are restricted to registered users, with authentication accomplished using JSON Web Tokens, since each user have its own list of books.
